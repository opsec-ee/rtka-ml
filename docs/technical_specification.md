# RTKA-ML Technical Specification v0.1

Copyright (c) 2025 - H.Overman opsec.ee@pm.me

## Document Scope

This specification describes the current implementation of the RTKA-ML proof of concept as of January 2025. It documents only features that are actually implemented in the code, excluding planned or aspirational functionality.

## Implementation Status

The current implementation provides core ternary logic operations based on Kleene's three-valued system. The code includes basic tensor data structures and simple neural network layers. A memory pool system handles allocation, though its performance characteristics are not validated. The implementation is single-threaded with minimal error handling.

## Core Data Types

### Ternary Values

The system defines ternary values using an enumeration mapped to integers for arithmetic operations. The encoding uses -1 for FALSE, 0 for UNKNOWN or MAYBE, and 1 for TRUE. Internal storage uses int8_t to reduce memory consumption, though this requires type conversion during computation.

```c
typedef rtka_value_t trit_t;  // Alias for consistency
typedef int8_t trit_storage_t;  // Storage format
```

### Tensor Structure

Tensors store ternary values with associated confidence scores and gradients for learning. The structure supports up to four dimensions, though only 1D and 2D tensors have been tested. Memory is allocated from a pool rather than using individual malloc calls.

```c
typedef struct ternary_tensor {
    trit_storage_t* data;    // Ternary values as int8_t
    float* confidence;       // Confidence scores [0,1]
    float* gradients;       // Gradient storage
    size_t dims[4];         // Dimension sizes
    size_t ndims;           // Number of dimensions
    size_t total_size;      // Total elements
    memory_pool_t* pool;    // Memory pool reference
} ternary_tensor_t;
```

## Implemented Functions

### Tensor Operations

The implementation provides basic tensor creation and destruction functions. The tensor_create function allocates memory from a pool and initializes confidence values to 1.0. Size validation prevents integer overflow during allocation, though edge cases may not be fully handled.

```c
ternary_tensor_t* tensor_create(size_t* dims, size_t ndims);
void tensor_destroy(ternary_tensor_t* tensor);
```

Batch operations compute logical AND and OR on tensor elements. These functions validate input dimensions and return error codes on mismatch. SIMD optimization paths exist but are conditionally compiled and not thoroughly tested.

```c
rtka_error_t batch_ternary_and(ternary_tensor_t* out,
                               const ternary_tensor_t* a,
                               const ternary_tensor_t* b);
```

### Neural Network Layers

Layer creation allocates weight and bias tensors with random initialization. The forward pass computes weighted sums using ternary arithmetic. An activation function maps continuous values to ternary states, though its mathematical properties are not rigorously analyzed.

```c
ternary_layer_t* layer_create(size_t input_size, size_t output_size);
rtka_error_t layer_forward(ternary_layer_t* layer, const ternary_tensor_t* input);
```

### Training Functions

The training infrastructure includes gradient computation and basic weight updates. Learning is achieved through confidence adjustment rather than changing discrete ternary values. The implementation supports several loss functions including MSE and cross-entropy, though convergence properties are not established.

```c
rtka_error_t compute_gradients(ternary_tensor_t* tensor,
                              const float* target,
                              float learning_rate);
```

### Model Persistence

Basic serialization saves model weights and architecture to binary files. The format lacks versioning, checksums, or compression. Loading performs minimal validation and may fail silently on corrupted files.

```c
int save_model(ternary_layer_t** layers, size_t num_layers, const char* filename);
ternary_layer_t** load_model(const char* filename, size_t* num_layers_out);
```

## Memory Management

The memory pool system pre-allocates aligned blocks to reduce allocation overhead. Pools maintain usage statistics though these are not exposed through the API. The implementation uses atomic operations for thread-safe allocation, but the rest of the system is not thread-safe.

Memory alignment is fixed at 64 bytes to match typical cache line sizes. This may waste memory for small allocations. Pool exhaustion returns NULL without attempting to allocate additional memory.

## Error Handling

The implementation defines error codes but does not use them consistently throughout the codebase. Many functions return NULL on failure without indicating the specific error cause. Error propagation through the call stack is incomplete.

```c
typedef enum {
    RTKA_SUCCESS = 0,
    RTKA_ERROR_NULL_PARAM = -1,
    RTKA_ERROR_DIMENSION_MISMATCH = -2,
    RTKA_ERROR_OVERFLOW = -3,
    RTKA_ERROR_ALLOCATION_FAILED = -4
} rtka_error_t;
```

## Random Number Generation

The system uses xoshiro256** for random number generation with thread-local state. Initialization attempts to read from /dev/urandom with fallback to time-based seeding enhanced with process and thread identifiers. The quality of the fallback entropy is not cryptographically secure.

## Build Configuration

The code uses conditional compilation for optional features. C23 features like ckd_mul are used when available with C11 fallbacks. SIMD optimization requires explicit compiler flags and processor support. The build system does not automatically detect capabilities.

```c
#if __STDC_VERSION__ >= 202311L
    #define HAS_C23 1
#endif

#ifdef __AVX2__
    #define HAS_SIMD 1
#endif
```

## Performance Characteristics

The implementation includes SIMD paths for confidence calculations, but performance improvements are not quantified. Memory pooling reduces allocation calls, though the actual overhead reduction has not been measured. The use of int8_t for ternary storage reduces memory usage by approximately 75% compared to int representation.

Early termination optimizations exist in some functions but their effectiveness is unknown. Cache alignment may improve performance on some architectures while wasting memory on others.

## Limitations

The current implementation has significant limitations that prevent production use. Thread safety is limited to memory pool allocation with no synchronization for tensor operations. Error handling is inconsistent with many failure cases causing undefined behavior. Numerical stability in gradient calculations is not analyzed or guaranteed. The test suite is incomplete with most test cases unimplemented. Performance has not been systematically benchmarked or optimized.

Input validation exists but may not catch all edge cases. Integer overflow protection is implemented for some operations but not comprehensively tested. The serialization format is fragile and lacks backward compatibility.

## Testing Status

A test framework skeleton using Criterion exists but requires external installation. Most test functions are defined but not implemented. No continuous integration or automated testing is configured. Coverage analysis has not been performed.

Memory leak detection requires manual Valgrind runs. Fuzzing and stress testing are mentioned but not implemented. Benchmark code exists but has not been validated against real workloads.

## Dependencies

The implementation requires C11 compiler support for atomic operations and aligned allocation. POSIX threads are required for atomic operations even in single-threaded use. The math library is required for standard functions. Optional dependencies include Criterion for testing and AVX2 for SIMD optimization.

## File Organization

The codebase consists of a single implementation file with all functionality. No modular organization or separate compilation units exist. Header files are minimal with most definitions in the implementation file. This monolithic structure makes the code difficult to maintain and extend.

## Conclusion

This specification documents the actual state of the RTKA-ML proof of concept without speculation or marketing language. The implementation demonstrates basic feasibility of ternary logic in neural networks but requires substantial development before practical use. Users should expect experimental behavior and be prepared to debug and extend the code for their specific needs.
